# secure-weatherapp-client
This is a simple client that connects to a server to retrieve weather information for a specified city. The client uses OpenSSL to establish a secure connection with the server and sends a JSON-formatted request with the city name to the server. The server responds with a JSON-formatted message, which the client parses and displays to the user.
